# Your username and password will be your login username and password used on your VPN website.
# 'host' will come from your VPN provider's website.
# Notice that there is an '@' sign used to separate password from host. Your username and password shouldn't use that character.
# If your login info does include an '@' symbol, you should replace '@' with '%40' and ':' with '%3A'
