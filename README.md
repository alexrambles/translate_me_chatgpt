# translate_me_chatgpt is a WIP. It's probably broken--I make no promises. I'm constantly updating it. It'll have a version once it's up and running properly!
Using ChatGPT and google translate to translate scraped webnovels in other languages.

## Current State:
    ### NOT A WORKING MODULE RIGHT NOW.
    -using google translate instead of chatgpt. I'm going to concentrate on getting it functional before integrating ChatGPT. Hopefully I can build this in a way that allows users to use either chatGPT or google translate. That way the API isn't necessary, and it can stay free.

## Features Planned:
    - translate strings
    - translate html files
    - identify language
    - integrate training feature where you can correct translations
    - the ability to correct the dictionary (custom dictionary that takes precedence over transator's dict?)

## Current Bugs
